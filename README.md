# Paxton RESTful Gateway

## Start of the creation of a RESTful api for paxton Net2 software

## Initial goal is s suite of small independent c# programs that can be called from Django to add/remove users and add/remove departments.

## we will add a django project here that has these two tables modelled. Django admin will be used to add/remove users and departments. TYhen a Django admin sync command can be called that uses thew suite of c#.programs to update Net2 software with the django models.
 
# #here is also a sync command that reads in the current Net2 setup to these Django models.

## Colin is provided the c# programs.

## Will / Dave is putting in a django app with these models setup.
